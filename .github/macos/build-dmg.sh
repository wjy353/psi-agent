# Assemble, sign, notarize and package HaiTun Agent.app into a dmg.
#
# Single entry point for both CI and local runs. Signing and notarization are
# opt-in **by secret presence**, not by a flag: with no certificate configured
# the script still produces a working (unsigned) dmg, and once the Apple
# Developer certificate lands you only add secrets — no code change here.
#
# Version comes from `.github/inno-setup/haitun.iss` MyAppVersion, the same
# single source of truth as the Windows launcher (build-haitun-launcher.ps1:10)
# and the same value oss-publish.yml gates on. macOS shares
# `haitun-version.txt` with Windows, so it must not invent its own numbering.
#
# Inputs (env):
#   PSI_AGENT_BIN                 path to the PyInstaller binary (required)
#   HAITUN_DOWNLOAD_BASE_URL      updater base url; empty disables update checks
#   HAITUN_UPDATE_INTERVAL_HOURS  updater interval, default 24
#   P12_CERTIFICATE(+P12_PASSWORD) base64 p12 and its password -> enables signing
#   MACOS_KEYCHAIN_PWD            temp keychain password (optional; has a default)
#   APPLE_ID/APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD/APPLE_TEAM_ID -> enables notarization

# `syspolicy_check distribution` for app bundles on macOS 14+.
#

#  - DTS calls the command-line route "a quick, albeit less accurate test".
#    The authoritative test is downloading via Safari onto a clean machine that
#    has never seen the product, then pulling the network to prove stapling.
#  - This runs on the machine that just signed the dmg, whose keychain holds the
#    signing certificate. That state does not exist on a user's Mac.
# No quarantine attribute is stamped: spctl assesses unconditionally, so a fake
# xattr would add nothing but a false impression of fidelity.
