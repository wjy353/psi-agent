# CFBundleExecutable for HaiTun Agent.app — the macOS counterpart to haitun.c.
#
# Mirrors haitun.c steps 1-8, minus the parts Windows only needs:
#   - no MSYS on PATH: nothing in the product shells out to node/uv/bash. The
#     only subprocess call in the whole tree is `open -R` in
#     _workspace_manager.py, which macOS provides natively.
#   - no .env-in-install-dir reads for PATH fixup, only for env injection.
#
# The one structural difference from Windows: a signed .app must stay read-only
# (writing inside the bundle breaks the signature and Gatekeeper then refuses to
# launch it). The agent package is written at runtime — .env, logs/, .private/ —
# so it is seeded out of Resources/ into Application Support on first run.

# --default-agent must be explicit: _defaults.py resolve_default_agent() only
# soft-detects a repo checkout or a cwd that looks like an agent package, and

# --default-workspace matches DEFAULT_USER_WORKSPACE_NAME ("haitun交付").
#
# --gateway is likewise explicit because it is **required** (gateway/__init__.py
# declares it `tyro.MISSING`): which HTTP surfaces to mount is the deployer's
# call, since mounting one too few fails silently -- some frontend 404s and
# nothing logs. Omitting it is not a soft default but a tyro exit **2** before
# the Gateway starts, which is what this launcher hit: the dmg shipped, was
# signed and notarized, and died the instant it was launched. `desktop` alone
# matches haitun.c:698 -- the dmg, like the installer, ships only the ToC
# surface, and adding `feishu` would mount ToB routes no installed user reaches.
