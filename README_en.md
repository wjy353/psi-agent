# psi-agent

> [中文](README.md)

A microkernel framework for assembling AI agents from composable socket-connected components.

You write Python functions and Markdown. The framework handles socket communication, tool calling, SSE streaming, cron scheduling, and conversation persistence, and provides a Web management console.

## Why

- **Simple composition**: ai, session, channel — three standalone processes connected through sockets. No global config, no database
- **Workspace is the agent**: Drop Python functions in `workspace/` for tools, write a system prompt for personality, add a cron for scheduled tasks
- **Streaming interactions**: REPL/CLI show AI reasoning (dimmed) and final response in real time
- **One-command launch**: `psi-agent run config.yml` starts AI + Session + Channel from a single YAML
- **Web management console**: `psi-agent gateway --gateway desktop` starts a REST API + Web Console SPA for visual management

## Architecture

```
User ←→ Channel (REPL/CLI/Telegram/Feishu) ── TCP/Unix/Named Pipe ── Session ── TCP/Unix/Named Pipe ── AI
User ←→ Web UI → HTTP → Gateway ── TCP/Unix/Named Pipe ── Session ── TCP/Unix/Named Pipe ── AI
```

AI layer is stateless. Session maintains conversation history. Channel is a pure UI client — the three core components are independent processes communicating via the OpenAI Chat Completions HTTP/SSE protocol over sockets. Gateway provides an HTTP bridge for the Web UI, internally reusing Channel sockets to communicate with Session.

For developers: start components independently, mix and match for debugging and customization. For users: `psi-agent run config.yml` launches everything in one command, and `psi-agent gateway --gateway desktop` provides a visual web console for managing everything.

## Quick Start

**Requires Python >= 3.14**

### Option 1: Start individually

Three terminals, three commands:

```bash
# Install
uv sync

# Terminal 1: Start AI backend (--provider/--model/--api-key/--base-url are optional, fall back to PSI_AI_* env vars)
uv run psi-agent ai \
  --provider openai \
  --session-socket ./ai.sock \
  --model gpt-4o-mini \
  --api-key sk-xxxx \
  --base-url https://api.openai.com/v1

# Terminal 2: Start Session (--workspace optional, defaults to .)
uv run psi-agent session \
  --workspace ./examples/a-simple-bash-only-workspace \
  --channel-socket ./channel.sock \
  --ai-socket ./ai.sock

# Terminal 3: Interactive REPL
uv run psi-agent channel repl --session-socket ./channel.sock
```

REPL controls: `Enter` to insert a newline, `Alt+Enter` (or `Escape+Enter`) to send, `Ctrl+D` to exit.

Or one-shot:

```bash
uv run psi-agent channel cli \
  --session-socket ./channel.sock \
  --message "List files in the current directory"
```

### Option 2: YAML batch launch

Write a `config.yml` and launch everything with one command:

```bash
uv run psi-agent run config.yml
```

`config.yml` format:

```yaml
- type: ai
  provider: openai
  session_socket: ./ai.sock
  model: gpt-4o-mini
  api_key: sk-xxxx                 # AI params are optional: omit to fall back to PSI_AI_* env vars
  base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1

- type: session
  workspace: ./examples/a-simple-bash-only-workspace  # optional, defaults to .
  session_id: mychat         # optional, UUID auto-generated
  channel_socket: ./channel.sock
  ai_socket: ./ai.sock

- type: channel
  name: repl                        # cli / repl / telegram / feishu
  session_socket: ./channel.sock
```

Servers (ai, session) run forever; channel components exit when done — CLI exits after the response, REPL runs until Ctrl+D.

> **Note**: `psi-agent run` does not exit automatically (ai/session run forever) — use `Ctrl+C` to stop. Batch mode always enables DEBUG-level logging; per-component `verbose` fields in the YAML are ignored.

### Option 3: Gateway Web Console

Start the Gateway and manage everything in your browser:

```bash
uv run psi-agent gateway --gateway desktop       # Random port on 127.0.0.1
uv run psi-agent gateway --gateway desktop --listen http://127.0.0.1:8080   # Specify a listen address
```

`--gateway` is **required**: it selects which HTTP surfaces to mount. `desktop` is the Web Console described here (the ToC surface); `feishu` is the Feishu/Lark surface (ToB); pass both to mount both. Having no default is deliberate — mounting one surface too few does not raise an error, it just 404s some frontend, so the choice must be stated at startup.

Open the printed address to see a Material Design 3 Web Console. From the UI you can:

- **Connect LLMs**: Choose from 50+ providers, enter your API key
- **Create sessions**: Pick a workspace directory, start a Session
- **Chat**: Markdown + LaTeX rendering, file upload/download, streaming output
- **Manage**: Sidebar session switching, double-click rename, delete with confirmation
- **Automatic titles**: AI generates session titles after first conversation

The `--listen` value must include the `http://` prefix. A bare `IP:PORT` matches no prefix and falls through to the bare-path branch: on POSIX it is interpreted as a Unix socket path, while on Windows it raises `ValueError` outright (see "Transport Abstraction" below).

Gateway also supports system tray icon (`--tray --icon icon.png`), auto browser open (`--browser`), native webview window (`--webview`), and custom socket path prefix (`--socket-path psi`, controlling the `/tmp/{prefix}/ais/...` and `/tmp/{prefix}/channels/...` layout for AI/Session Unix sockets).

### Option 4: Run with Nix

With Nix installed (flakes enabled), no need to set up Python, node, or dependencies by hand:

```bash
nix run github:genuineknowledge/psi-agent -- gateway --listen http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

The flake is headless (no native `--webview`/`--tray` window features); the Web Console still works in a regular browser. The runtime tools it needs — `uv`, `node`/`npx`, `bash`, `git` — are baked into the executable's PATH, so workspace tools/skills that spawn subprocesses can find them.

Flake outputs:

- `packages.default` (= `psi-agent`): executable with runtime tools on PATH, the `nix run` entry point
- `packages.psi-agent-unwrapped`: the plain Python environment without PATH injection
- `packages.psi-agent-spa`: the Vue frontend built on its own
- `devShells.default`: development environment (see "Development")

## Transports

All components auto-detect transport type via address prefix:

| Address Format | Transport |
|----------------|-----------|
| `./ai.sock` (bare filesystem path, relative or absolute) | Unix socket (POSIX only) |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8080` | TCP |
| `\\.\pipe\name` (Windows) | Named Pipe (Windows only) |

AI and Session components are transport-agnostic — handled uniformly by `_sockets.py`.

> **Windows note**: Windows has no Unix sockets (asyncio lacks `create_unix_connection`), so a bare filesystem path is **rejected outright with a clear `ValueError`** rather than falling through to a Unix socket and crashing with a context-free `NotImplementedError` deep inside aiohttp. On Windows use a named-pipe address `\\.\pipe\name`; when passing it through a POSIX shell (e.g. bash single-quotes) the backslashes must survive — a single-backslash `\.\pipe\...` fails the named-pipe prefix check, is treated as a bare path, and triggers the same `ValueError`.

> **POSIX note**: Conversely, named pipes only work on Windows (they need asyncio's `ProactorEventLoop`, a class that does not exist off Windows), so a `\\.\pipe\name` address on Linux/macOS is likewise **rejected outright with a clear `ValueError`** instead of letting aiohttp's internal platform check fail with a context-free `AttributeError`. On POSIX use a bare filesystem path or a TCP address.

Protocol errors between components take two forms:

- **Non-streaming (HTTP level)**: request parsing failures return HTTP error status with a JSON body:
  ```json
  {"error": {"message": "...", "type": "...", "param": null, "code": 400}}
  ```
- **Streaming (SSE level)**: errors after HTTP 200 is committed are returned as ChatCompletionChunk (`[DONE]` varies by layer, see below):
  ```
  data: {"id": "error", "choices": [{"index": 0, "delta": {"content": "[Upstream Error]: ..."}, "finish_reason": "error"}]}
  ```
  `finish_reason="error"` is a psi-agent internal extension, not exposed externally. `[DONE]` is always sent by Gateway; the Session layer sends it only on success; the AI layer never sends `[DONE]` (stream end is indicated by response completion).

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `PSI_AI_PROVIDER` | AI provider (openai / anthropic / gemini ...) |
| `PSI_AI_MODEL` | Model name |
| `PSI_AI_API_KEY` | API key |
| `PSI_AI_BASE_URL` | Upstream base URL |
| `PSI_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Telegram bot token |
| `PSI_TELEGRAM_PROXY` | Telegram SOCKS5 proxy |
| `PSI_FEISHU_APP_ID` | Feishu app ID |
| `PSI_FEISHU_APP_SECRET` | Feishu app secret |

CLI args take precedence over environment variables. AI params (provider, model, api_key, base_url) and channel auth params are optional and fall back to env vars when omitted. Socket path params (--session-socket, --channel-socket, --ai-socket) are required.

## Define Your Own Agent

A workspace is an agent:

```
my-workspace/
├── tools/                    # Each non-_-prefixed .py file — all non-_ async def in it
│   └── bash.py               # async def bash(command: str) -> str
├── skills/                   # */SKILL.md skill docs (enumerated by system_prompt_builder)
├── schedules/                # Cron-triggered tasks
│   └── daily-report/
│       └── TASK.md           # YAML header (name, cron) + Markdown body
└── systems/
    └── system.py             # async def system_prompt_builder() / system_prompt_rebuild_checker() / turn_context_builder()
```

### Tools

A tool is just an async function — in each non-`_`-prefixed `.py` file, every non-`_` `async def` is loaded as a tool:

```python
# tools/bash.py
import anyio

async def bash(command: str) -> str:
    """Execute a bash command.
    Args:
        command: The command to run.
    """
    result = await anyio.run_process(["/bin/bash", "-c", command])
    return result.stdout.decode().strip()
```

- Supported parameter types: `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `list[X]`, `X | None`
- Google-style docstrings (`Args:` section) are automatically converted to tool descriptions
- Tools are hot-reloaded before every agent turn — modify files without restarting

### System Prompt

Define three optional async functions in `systems/system.py`:

```python
async def system_prompt_builder() -> str:
    """Construct the system prompt. Returns a string."""
    return "You are a helpful assistant."

async def system_prompt_rebuild_checker() -> bool:
    """Called before every agent turn. Return True to rebuild the system prompt."""
    return False

async def turn_context_builder() -> str:
    """Called before every agent turn. Returns this turn's volatile block (the
    clock, runtime info), carried on this turn's own user message."""
    return render_volatile_sections()
```

- `builder` is lazily called on the first conversation turn
- `checker` runs before each turn, useful for auto-refreshing prompts when files change
- `turn_context_builder` runs every turn, and its output does **not** go into the system
  prompt — it rides on this turn's user message, at the **tail** of the request. Why not in
  the prompt: rebuilding it per turn means rescanning the whole workspace per turn, and
  upstream caches by prefix while the system prompt is the *front* of the request — so a
  prompt that changes every turn can never be cached however the cache is configured. At
  the tail, the change is confined to that one turn and the prefix stays stable, which is
  what makes enabling caching possible (the framework does not enable it: Anthropic's
  prompt caching is opt-in and needs a top-level `cache_control`). Without it the whole
  prompt never changes within a Session, freezing everything in it that describes *now* at
  first-build time
- All three are optional; sensible defaults are used when absent. A `turn_context_builder`
  that raises, returns a non-string, or returns an empty string is treated as "no block" —
  losing a clock line is a far smaller problem than losing the turn

### Scheduled Tasks

Defined in `schedules/<name>/TASK.md` with YAML front matter specifying name and cron expression. The body is sent to the AI as a message when triggered:

```markdown
---
name: daily-report
cron: "0 12 * * *"
---
Generate a daily progress report.
```

- Each schedule has an independent CancelScope and supports hot-reload
- Each schedule is loaded independently — IO errors, YAML parsing issues, or cron validation failures only skip that schedule
- Schedule triggers acquire the session lock and execute serially
- **Schedules belong to the workspace; the right to fire belongs to a (session × schedule) pair**: `schedules/` is always loaded from the workspace (never from the `--agent` package under a split-root setup), and every Session sees all entries — but activation is decided per entry. `--active-schedules a,b` fires just those two; `--active-schedules '*'` fires all of them, including entries created after startup; `--deactive-schedules x` carves entries out (the blacklist wins). The default activates none. Write `'*'` plus a blacklist for "everything except these" — an enumerated whitelist cannot cover `TASK.md` files created later. Each schedule must be activated by exactly one Session, otherwise a single reminder would fire once per online session (Feishu spawns one Session per user). Under Gateway, `SchedulerManager` maintains exactly one fully activated scheduler session per workspace (which AI it mounts is set by `psi-agent gateway --scheduler-ai-id`, falling back to `--feishu-ai-id`; with both empty no scheduler session is started — once the first `TASK.md` appears and an AI is available, a resident `watch_loop` starts the scheduler session automatically, within at most one 30s polling round)

### Skills

Create `SKILL.md` files under any directory in `skills/`:

```
skills/
└── my-skill/
    └── SKILL.md       # Arbitrary Markdown content
```

`system_prompt_builder` should, by convention, scan `skills/*/SKILL.md`, parse YAML front matter, and inject content into the system prompt. The psi-agent framework does not directly parse skill files — the workspace defines how to use them.

### Conversation History Persistence

Session automatically persists conversation history to `workspace/histories/{session_id}.jsonl`:

- `--session-id` auto-generates a UUID when omitted; provide a custom ID to resume a session (only `[a-zA-Z0-9_-]` allowed)
- JSONL line-by-line format, atomic writes (temp file + `anyio.Path.replace`)
- **Turn-level atomicity**: user message is persisted immediately as a crash baseline; AI responses are persisted only on successful completion, skipped on error

```bash
# New session
uv run psi-agent session --session-id mychat --channel-socket ./channel.sock --ai-socket ./ai.sock

# Resume later
uv run psi-agent session --session-id mychat --channel-socket ./channel.sock --ai-socket ./ai.sock
```

## Gateway REST API

Gateway exposes the following REST endpoints (see [Gateway layer docs](src/psi_agent/gateway/AGENTS.md) for details):

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/ais` | Create AI instance |
| DELETE | `/ais/{ai_id}` | Delete AI |
| GET | `/ais` | List all AIs |
| POST | `/sessions` | Create Session |
| DELETE | `/sessions/{session_id}` | Delete Session |
| GET | `/sessions` | List all Sessions |
| POST | `/sessions/{session_id}/chat` | Web UI chat (SSE stream) |
| GET | `/sessions/{session_id}/history` | Get conversation history |
| POST | `/feishu/route` | Idempotently route a Feishu chat to a Session: group chats by chat_id (whole chat shares one), DMs by open_id (one per user); spawn on first use |
| GET | `/feishu/routes` | List Feishu chat → Session routes |
| GET | `/titles` | Get all session titles |
| POST | `/titles` | Set session title |
| POST | `/titles/generate` | AI auto-generate title |
| GET | `/workspace/browse` | Browse directory (`?path=...`) |
| GET | `/workspace/cwd` | Get working directory |
| GET | `/openapi.json` | OpenAPI schema |
| GET | `/favicon.ico` | Favicon (available only with `--icon`; returns 404 otherwise) |

### Web Console Chat Protocol

`POST /sessions/{session_id}/chat` accepts a list of Chunks and returns an SSE stream:

**Request:**
```json
{
  "chunks": [
    {"type": "text", "text": "Hello!"},
    {"type": "blob", "name": "image.png", "data": "base64..."}
  ]
}
```

**Response (SSE):**
```
data: {"type": "reasoning", "text": "Let me think..."}
data: {"type": "text", "text": "Hello! "}
data: {"type": "blob", "name": "generated.png", "data": "base64..."}
data: {"type": "error", "error": "..."}
data: [DONE]
```

## Advanced: Telegram / Feishu Bot

### Telegram

```bash
uv run psi-agent channel telegram \
  --session-socket ./channel.sock \
  --bot-token $PSI_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN \
  --allowed-user-ids 123456789 \
  --proxy socks5://127.0.0.1:1080
```

- Supports text, photos, and documents
- Streaming output: incremental `edit_text` for a typewriter effect
- User whitelist: `--allowed-user-ids` optional
- SOCKS5 proxy: `--proxy` CLI arg or `PSI_TELEGRAM_PROXY` env var

### Feishu

```bash
uv run psi-agent channel feishu \
  --session-socket ./channel.sock \
  --app-id $PSI_FEISHU_APP_ID \
  --app-secret $PSI_FEISHU_APP_SECRET \
  --allowed-user-ids "ou_abc123"
```

- WebSocket long connection, SDK background thread + anyio portal bridge
- Card streaming: `stream.append()` updates Feishu cards incrementally
- Processing status emoji: `Typing` while processing, removed on completion, `CrossMark` on failure
- Supports text, images, files, and audio
- Doc comment replies: `--respond-to-comments` (on by default) — when the bot is @-mentioned in a document comment, reply to that comment with the agent's answer (requires subscribing to `drive.notice.comment_add_v1` in the Feishu console)
- Per-chat isolated sessions: with `--gateway-url http://127.0.0.1:8080`, on the first message from a given chat the Gateway idempotently spawns a dedicated Session (isolated workspace subdir and history). Two routing keys: **DMs by sender open_id** (one Session per user, workspace `<root>/<open_id>`) and **group chats by chat_id** (`chat_type` group/topic — the whole chat shares one Session, workspace `<root>/chat-<chat_id>`), so the bot keeps coherent context across everyone in a group while group-to-group and group-to-DM contexts stay separate. The mounted AI and workspace parent dir are set via the Gateway's `--feishu-ai-id` / `--feishu-workspace-root`. Without `--gateway-url` all chats share `--session-socket` (unchanged behavior). Falls back to the shared socket if the Gateway is unreachable

## Example Workspaces

The `examples/` directory contains several workspaces ranging from minimal to production-grade — from single-tool setups, scheduled tasks, and MCP integration, to multi-tier system prompts, persistent memory, and Telegram/Feishu bots. See the `examples/` directory for details.

## Development

```bash
uv run ruff check .          # lint
uv run ruff format --check . # format
uv run ty check              # types
uv run pytest -v             # tests
```

With Nix, `nix develop` drops you into a dev shell with Python 3.14, `uv`, and `node`, after which the `uv run ...` commands above work as usual.
