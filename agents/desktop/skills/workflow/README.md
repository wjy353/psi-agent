# Workflow

Workflow is the workspace-local formal-language workflow system defined
by `grammar/FusionFlow.g4`. It includes the parser/compiler, graph compiler,
workflow runner, and authoring Skill. Program-backed Steps use an injected Program runner
contract; the workspace entry point implements it with a specialized Program
Agent and structured AnyIO `compile_program` / `execute_program` tools. The
Agent can prepare or install runtimes, dependencies, compilers, and other
toolchain components for multiple languages, while the host fixes or registers
the authoritative launch and captures its process result. Human-backed Steps use a dedicated instruction-preparation Agent, the
existing Haitun `clarify` flow, and a private checkpoint that crosses conversation
turns. Agent-backed Steps reuse `fusion_flow.execution.run()`, `flow.agent()`,
and `flow.session()` through the workspace `SessionRunner`. The
`fusion_flow.execution` package also owns the shared retry and bounded-parallel
primitives that the G4 graph interpreter reuses.

Every active G4 run also writes each materialized Artifact to the workflow
bundle's `runs/<run-id>/artifacts/` directory. Text values remain Markdown;
objects, arrays, numbers, booleans, and null are represented by a fenced
`json` block. This user-visible history is separate from private Human resume
state under `.psi/fusion-flow/runs/`.

## Workspace integration

Reusable declarations use one fixed bundle under `flows/workflows/<slug>/`.
The canonical source is `<slug>.workflow`, falling back to `<slug>.g4` when the
preferred file is absent. Saving, listing, and loading are upper-layer
instructions implemented with existing file tools; this feature does not add a
workflow-management operator or manifest protocol.

To reuse a saved declaration, ask for it by name (for example,
`调用 daily-brief 的 workflow`). Resolve only an existing slug under the
canonical path, prefer `<slug>.workflow`, and fall back to
`<slug>.g4`. Read the declaration and collect every declared input through
normal conversation before the initial `run_flow` call; never use a call with
the default empty input object as an input probe. Each initial call starts a
fresh run. If it reaches a Human Step, only the returned active request may
continue through `run_flow_resume`. An Agent Step may save a self-contained
child declaration but must not launch another workflow. Its relative
`read`/`write`/`edit` paths resolve against the psi workspace root, not the
launcher process CWD.

This Skill ships no runnable workflow registry. Workspace owners may commit
canonical reusable declarations under `flows/workflows/<slug>/`.

## Modules

- `grammar/FusionFlow.g4`: the syntax grammar; ordinary preset/external-operator arity remains checker-owned.
- `fusion_flow/generated/`: committed ANTLR 4.13.2 Python lexer and parser generated from the grammar.
- `fusion_flow/contracts.py`: diagnostics and parse/check phase results.
- `fusion_flow/core_ir.py`: immutable Workflow Core IR shared by compiler phases.
- `fusion_flow/parser.py`: parser facade and Workflow Core IR output boundary.
- `fusion_flow/checker.py`: static semantics boundary.
- `fusion_flow/compiler.py`: target-neutral Core IR traversal and backend hook boundary.
- `fusion_flow/workflow_graph/`: immutable Step-Artifact graph model, validation, and deterministic serialization.
- `fusion_flow/workflow_execution.py`: graph planning and interpretation, dependency waits, concurrency, resources, timeouts, and checkpoints; retry and parallel scheduling reuse the shared Flow helpers.
- `fusion_flow/graph_compiler.py`: concrete `CoreIRCompiler` backend that builds `fusion_flow.workflow_graph` models.
- `fusion_flow/workflow_runner.py`: fail-closed compile/plan/execute entry point with Agent, Human, Program, and checkpoint injection boundaries.
- `fusion_flow/artifact_store.py`: atomic, workflow-local Markdown persistence for every materialized G4 Artifact.
- `fusion_flow/job_store.py`: strict v3 JSON state plus non-blocking, OS-released advisory leases and an in-process guard for G4 runs waiting on Human input.
- `fusion_flow/planning.py`: before workflow authoring, checks the syntax mappings declared for each planned step against the syntax names actually available. Each planned step maps to one catalog `Step` identity, which authoring expands into a typed constant and its assertions.
- `fusion_flow/execution/`: shared Python `flow.*` runtime; the G4 adapter reuses `run`/`agent`/`session`, and the graph interpreter reuses its private retry and bounded-parallel helpers.

The obsolete Node/TypeScript compiler prototype has been removed. The Python
compiler abstraction does not select or implement a concrete output target.
Runtime dependencies, including `antlr4-python3-runtime`, are declared in the
repository root `pyproject.toml` and locked by the root `uv.lock`; this Skill
has no independent npm install or per-Skill package lock.
`graph_compiler.py` is one concrete backend. The graph model and plan executor
remain internally decoupled from the parser/compiler/runner even though the
Workflow skill owns all of them.

## Current scope and known gaps

The language contract now covers file-level identity declarations, assertions, `!`/`AND`/`OR` formulas and comparisons, arithmetic, Lists, JSON-style quoted text, and value-producing `if(condition, then, else)` expressions. Workflow blocks contain assertions; a standalone Bool-returning operator call is shorthand for that call asserted equal to `True`. Concepts and operator signatures come from an external catalog, so quoted text is accepted by the surface grammar while typed catalogs decide where text is valid. The 21 preset operators are split into five disjoint owner groups. The canonical dataflow operators `input_workflow(Workflow)`, `output_workflow(Workflow)`, `consumes(Step)`, and `produces(Step)` return ordinary List terms. Their artifact relation is always explicit on the RHS, including singleton forms such as `consumes(step) == [artifact]`; the removed `*_multi` spellings and former two-argument Bool relations have no compatibility aliases. `program_path` and `agent_system_prompt` remain typed executor configuration; a short `step_instruction` may contain quoted text and a longer one may use an explicit `./...` instruction-file reference. `FusionFlow.g4` fixes `if` at three arguments while ordinary preset and externally registered operators keep flexible call arity for checker-owned validation.

For a compact, readable BNF and consistency with KEDispatcher, preset operators remain syntax sugar over the same flexible call rule instead of receiving separate arity-constrained grammar productions. After syntax parsing, the checker/catalog validates their arity and types. Because that information is intentionally not encoded structurally in the BNF, every preset operator in `FusionFlow.g4` documents its parameter types, return type, and explicit arity for human and agent readers; the grammar contract test enforces this documentation invariant.

The generated Python lexer and parser are committed under `fusion_flow/generated/` and wired into the handwritten Python Core IR visitor. Syntax failures return one-based, half-open source spans without partial Core IR. Repeated equivalent constant declarations reuse one identity, conflicting declarations fail, and every symbolic or restricted quoted-ID constant must be declared with at least one concept before use. Direct JSON text literals are accepted where the catalog expects `Instruction` or `StepName`; `step_name` requires that readable string form and rejects symbolic `StepName` values. Numeric and Boolean literals use the KEDispatcher builtin symbols and concepts `ComplexNumber` and `Bool`, while quoted identifiers remain distinct from those literals. Standalone calls require a catalog output concept of `Bool` and become an ordinary `Assertion` against `True`; explicit `== True` remains equivalent. Formula equality becomes an `Assertion`, `!=` intentionally remains `NOT` over an `Assertion`, and ordered comparisons become the corresponding KEDispatcher `comparison_*_op` application asserted equal to `True`. `WorkflowFile` retains global declarations and multiple workflow blocks, while `IfTerm` retains conditional terms without approximation. Shorthand eligibility uses the catalog return concept; operator registration and arity, other catalog type compatibility, workflow legality, and backend support remain static-checker responsibilities.

The Core IR contains catalog-owned `Concept` and `Operator` references, typed constants, recursive compound and conditional terms, ordered list terms, equality assertions, and `NOT`/`AND`/`OR` formulas. `WorkflowFile` stores declarations and ordered workflow blocks; each `Workflow` stores one syntax-level block name with its assertions. The workflow does not redeclare concepts or operators.

`CoreIRCompiler` follows the same template-method design as KEDispatcher's shared Core IR compiler: `compile()` owns traversal, concrete backends override protected node hooks, unsupported nodes fail explicitly, and the compiler does not retain the supplied `WorkflowFile`.

`WorkflowGraphCompiler` uses that traversal directly. It reads the real Core IR,
including `ListTerm.items` returned by the four canonical dataflow operators,
and returns one `WorkflowGraphCompilation` per workflow. Recognized dependency
assertions become graph nodes, edges, or typed policy. In addition to dataflow
and ordinary Step policy, the backend consumes `independent`,
`resource_requirement`, and the explicit control-order relation `depends_on`.
`depends_on` is a runner-registered typed catalog extension over the grammar's
generic operator-call syntax, not a new member of the grammar's 21 canonical
preset operators.
Unknown well-formed assertions remain in `residual_assertions`. A top-level
`selected == if(condition, artifact_a, artifact_b)` lowers to an eager
`SelectNode`; both candidates must be declared Artifacts and both producers run.
Downstream dataflow consumes `[selected]`. Priority selection uses named
intermediate Artifacts; inline or nested `if` terms fail closed.
The graph compiler preserves `program_path`, `agent_system_prompt`, and
`allowed_tool` as residual catalog/dispatcher configuration. The official
workflow runner consumes and validates all three, and Agent leaves execute
through shared `flow.agent` and `flow.session` primitives. Agent
`model`/`engine`/`api_base` overrides are parsed but fail explicitly until the
fixed AI socket can route them. Malformed supported relations and unsupported
recursive terms fail explicitly. An
official execution entry point must reject any final residual rather than skip
or delete it. The graph is serializable, but the compilation is not a
replacement for the original Core IR.

Because `Assertion` is equality, one recognized graph call may appear on either
side. The backend normalizes that call before lowering and explicitly rejects an
equality containing recognized graph calls on both sides.

The package exports `WorkflowGraphCompiler`, `WorkflowGraphCompilation`, and
`WorkflowGraphCompilationError`.

The Python embedding API has one first-release contract rather than parallel
compatibility spellings. `execute_workflow` requires `inputs=`. Agent and Human
callbacks receive exactly `(prompt, CompletionContext)`. `execute_plan`
requires `dispatch=`, whose `StepDispatcher` receives exactly
`(StepNode, inputs, DispatchContext)`. Agent completion results must be mappings
keyed by the exact declared output Artifact IDs. Untyped executor declarations
fail closed; graph values may remain untyped, but an explicitly typed graph
value must include `Artifact`.

The graph executor supports fixed resource pools supplied as positive
capacities or concrete instance IDs. It validates every requirement before
dispatch, atomically leases all resources needed by one Step, waits when
capacity is temporarily unavailable, and releases leases on success, failure,
timeout, or cancellation. Workflow `max_concurrency` and resource capacity both
apply.

The runner materializes every `./...` Step instruction through one injected
instruction resolver before dispatching any Step, caches shared references, and
passes the resulting text consistently to Agent, Human, and Program executors.
The public workspace adapter accepts UTF-8 Markdown files relative to the
containing `.workflow` or `.g4` file and rejects bundle escapes. If a validated
instruction file in a workflow whose executors are all Agent cannot be read,
the adapter delegates its normalized
workspace-relative reference through that Agent's Step prompt; unreadable Human
or Program instructions remain errors. Materialized text is included in the
durable workflow-definition digest used across Human wait/resume turns. Short
inline Instruction text bypasses file resolution.

Each Agent Step receives a `submit_step_result` tool whose schema requires its
exact output Artifact IDs; a valid submission supplies the Step result, and the
ephemeral agent turn closes after the current tool-call batch. Plain text remains
a fallback path only after a normally completed agent turn: the adapter
accepts one strict JSON object or one standalone, line-delimited `json` fence.
If parsing still fails and the Step has exactly one output, the original response
is bound to that Artifact verbatim and a structured warning is emitted without
logging the response body. Multi-output Steps receive two result-repair turns
first; if both fail, the first invalid response is broadcast verbatim to every
declared output and the same warning is emitted. This is deterministic copying,
not semantic splitting, and is the runtime default rather than an end-user
option. A zero-output Step may submit an exact empty object, but an invalid
response still fails after its repair turns because there is nowhere to bind raw
text. Truncated and tool-round-exhausted turns also fail instead of entering the
raw-text fallback. No fallback publishes only part of the declared result.

A Program executor must have exactly one `program_path(program) == path`
declaration. Absolute and explicit `./...` paths pass through; other path
identities require an injected resolver, and relative resolved paths require an
explicit working directory. The generic runner supplies the declared path as
logical `argv[0]`, sends `{"instruction": ..., "inputs": ...}` plus a newline on
stdin, carries the materialized instruction, consumed Artifact mapping, exact
output IDs, resource lease, and Step ID in `ProgramInvocation`, and accepts an
injected runner result. The public workspace adapter resolves the working
directory and declared script to regular files inside the workspace. A script
does not need a POSIX executable bit, a shebang, or `chmod`: the Program Agent
may select or install an interpreter, compile source, and execute the resulting
command.

Each Program Step gets a fresh specialized Session. Its preparation tools are
limited to workspace inspection plus `bash`/`powershell`; it cannot launch
another workflow. Fidelity-mode interpreted execution does not accept an
Agent-authored complete argv. The Agent selects one interpreter executable, and
the host constructs exactly
`[interpreter, declared_script, *logical_argv[1:]]`; interpreter flags, inline
code, another script, reordered or omitted logical arguments, and extra
arguments are not accepted. For compiled languages the Agent must call
`compile_program`, which runs the compiler and atomically registers its compiler
argv, the declared source hash, every declared artifact hash, and one exact
launch argv. `execute_program` accepts that compiled launch only while the
source and artifacts still match their registered hashes. These structured
tools capture stdout bytes, stderr bytes, exit status, and launch errors
separately. Shell tools are for environment inspection and installation, not
for authoritative compilation or execution. The Agent ends by calling the
zero-argument `submit_program_result`, which deterministically normalizes the
authoritative captured attempt rather than accepting model-authored Artifact
values.

Program execution defaults to fidelity mode. Before the real Program starts,
the Agent may install a missing runtime, dependency, compiler, or toolchain and
retry an environment or preparation failure. Once the real Program launches,
it is the sole attempt: the Agent must not call `execute_program` again,
regardless of nonzero exit, invalid-input/domain error, or invalid output.
The original captured result or error must remain authoritative. The Agent also
must not patch or replace the declared script, alter declared inputs/stdin, or
reinterpret output. Adaptation is enabled only when the resolved Step
instruction contains this exact standalone line:

```text
Program execution policy: successful completion outranks fidelity.
```

No paraphrase or input/tool/output content enables it. An authorized script or
stdin adaptation must include a concrete `adaptation_reason`, and consumed input
Artifact values remain immutable.

For a successful non-foreach attempt, zero-output Programs must write no stdout,
one output receives valid UTF-8 stdout verbatim, and multiple outputs require one strict,
finite JSON object keyed by all and only the declared Artifact IDs. Non-standard
constants such as `NaN` and `Infinity`, numeric overflow to infinity, nested
non-finite values, and duplicate object keys are rejected. A launch error,
nonzero exit, invalid UTF-8 stream, or output-contract failure in a non-foreach
Program produces the same
error value for every declared output:

```json
{
  "$fusion_flow/program_error": {
    "phase": "<input_format|agent|execution|output_format>",
    "kind": "<stable error kind>",
    "message": "<diagnostic>",
    "attempts": [
      {
        "argv": ["<actual>", "argv"],
        "exit_code": 1,
        "stdout": "partial output\n",
        "stderr": "failure detail\n",
        "stdout_base64": null,
        "stderr_base64": null,
        "error": null
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

A failing zero-output Program raises because no Artifact can carry the error.
Do not treat an error-valued Artifact as a repaired success. Inside `foreach`,
each Program iteration applies its own retry policy; terminal iteration failures
are checkpointed and reported together after the remaining iterations finish.

`execute_program` creates a separate POSIX process group or Windows Job Object
and performs shielded cleanup after normal direct-child exit, failure, timeout,
cancellation, or an output-limit violation. It streams both output pipes with
retained-output limits of 4 MiB for stdout and 1 MiB for stderr. Set
`PSI_FUSION_FLOW_PROGRAM_STDOUT_LIMIT_BYTES` or
`PSI_FUSION_FLOW_PROGRAM_STDERR_LIMIT_BYTES` to a positive integer to override
those defaults; crossing either limit terminates the process boundary. There is
no private 300-second Program cap: declared Step and workflow timeouts remain
the only execution deadlines. The Program Agent and its environment-installation
shell access are a trusted-workspace boundary, not a filesystem or host sandbox;
a POSIX descendant that deliberately creates a new session/process group can
leave the managed group.

A Human executor keeps instruction preparation and actual user input separate.
The runner gives a contextual preparer the resolved instruction text,
consumed Artifact values, resource lease, and exact output IDs. The public
adapter runs that preparer in its own ephemeral Session with a workspace-bound,
read-only `read` tool, validates its exact
`question/options/recommended/default` JSON, and persists a
`HumanRequestSpec`. It does not build a second approval UI.

The initial `run_flow` call returns a `waiting_for_human` envelope under the
reserved `$fusion_flow/control` key, which cannot collide with a G4 Artifact
ID. The parent Session passes its nested request fields to the existing
`clarify` tool, shows that tool's formatted text verbatim, and ends the turn.
The next user message is JSON-encoded and submitted with the matching `run_id`
and `request_id` to `run_flow_resume`. The generic executor validates and
restores an `ExecutionCheckpoint`, skips completed Steps/selections, and
continues until final outputs or the next Human Step. The request text is never
an Artifact; the submitted choice, free text, or structured value is the Human
Step result.

Every `ExecutionCheckpoint` is bound to its non-empty `workflow_id` and a
SHA-256 `plan_digest` over a canonical serialization of both graph semantics
and explicit plan fibers. Checkpoint values accept only strict, finite JSON
types and compare recursively without Python coercions such as `True == 1`.
Resume also validates known and unique operation IDs, dependency closure, and
the exact materialized-value set. The public workspace resume boundary
separately hashes the current workflow definition, including the `.workflow` or
`.g4` source and every referenced Markdown instruction, and rejects a run when
that digest differs from its persisted `definition_digest`.

Checkpoint observers publish state before releasing dependent operations.
Human waits release resource leases and Session ownership; workflow and Step
timeouts restart for each resumed execution phase rather than including time
spent waiting for a person. A wait cancels unfinished parallel fibers, so an
uncheckpointed side-effecting Step can run again after resume; workflows should
not place such a Step concurrently with a Human frontier when exactly-once
effects matter.

Persisted Human-run documents use the strict state-v3 schema, including the
workflow/plan-bound checkpoint and per-iteration fields. State-v2 documents,
other versions, and unknown or missing fields fail closed.

Each run resume keeps an advisory lock file handle open for its lease. Lock-file
existence is not ownership: the kernel releases the lock when the holder closes
it or exits, including an abrupt process crash. The `.lockfile` suffix is
separate from the former `.lock` directories, so stale directories from an
earlier runtime cannot block upgraded runs. The job store therefore requires a
filesystem with working local advisory-lock semantics.

A process-local reservation guard complements that advisory lock so two
callers in the same process cannot both acquire a platform lock whose semantics
are process-scoped.

`independent(step)` is a non-binding scheduling hint and never overrides
Artifact or explicit control dependencies. `depends_on(step, predecessor)`
forces the first Step to wait for the second even when no Artifact flows
between them; repeat the relation for multiple predecessors. Declaration order
has no scheduling meaning.

`ForeachEdge` expands one Step into bounded-parallel iterations, preserves input
order in each output List, returns empty Lists for empty input, and checkpoints
each iteration independently. Retry, timeout, resources, and crash recovery are
per iteration; ordinary terminal failures are collected and raised together.
Human `foreach`, feedback/input-plus-producer graphs, and circular Artifact or
explicit control awaits remain fail-closed execution-plan boundaries.

This remains a workspace-local package rather than a wheel dependency. The
graph interpreter stays in `workflow_execution.py`, while executor behavior is
reused from `execution/flow.py` wherever the shared primitive exists. Run all
tests from this directory so `fusion_flow` is on the runtime import path:

```powershell
uv run python -m pytest -q
```

Resource pools stay outside `.workflow`/`.g4` source and are supplied by the
embedding tool or application as counts or concrete instance IDs.

Variables, quantifiers, truth formulas, theories, rules, and query/SAT/optimization requests are intentionally absent because the reviewed workflow surface does not use them. Operator execution, concept registries and matching, validation, parsing, backend compilation, and Haitun activation remain separate workstreams.

| Item | Intended contract | Current gap | Required compiler behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `S01` | `input_workflow` and `output_workflow` declare external artifacts. | No gap in the official graph runner. | The generic `WorkflowGraph` executor enforces the exact input/output boundary and normalizes the injected Program result at the dispatcher boundary. |

## Activation boundary

Keep Program execution behind the injected runner boundary: one declared
script path in logical `argv`, the resolved Step instruction and consumed
Artifacts as JSON stdin, and exact output Artifact IDs in `ProgramInvocation`.
The workspace implementation runs a specialized Program Agent for environment
preparation. In fidelity mode the host fixes interpreted argv from the selected
interpreter, declared script, and logical arguments; compiled launches cross
`compile_program` to bind source/artifact hashes and exact launch argv before
crossing the bounded, whole-process-tree `execute_program` boundary. The real
Program may launch only once, and its original result or error remains
authoritative. The script is a workspace-contained regular file, not a
pre-authorized executable, and needs no executable permission. Agent Steps
cross the injected completion boundary through `flow.agent()` and
`flow.session()` inside one `fusion_flow.execution.run()` per durable G4 run.
Human Steps continue through the two-argument preparation/request callbacks
plus the generic checkpoint API; their suspend/resume protocol remains
graph-owned.

`AgentConfig.system_prompt` is the only Python field for an Agent's stable
system prompt. `AgentInvocation.prompt` remains the per-call prompt. The removed
`AgentConfig.system` / `AgentConfig.prompt` constructor spellings are not
compatibility aliases. Serialized Agent configurations and cache identities
use `system_prompt` directly.

The workspace activation path points at this directory for G4 source.
`skills/fusion-flow-legacy/` separately preserves the Node/TypeScript
`.flow.ts` runtime; callers must select that legacy skill explicitly rather
than translating between formats.

Saved workflow reuse resolves to `flows/workflows/<slug>/<slug>.workflow`,
falling back to `<slug>.g4`. This is an upper-layer storage convention, not a
new operator.

## Regenerating the Python parser

Run ANTLR 4.13.2 from this directory:

```powershell
java -jar antlr-4.13.2-complete.jar -Dlanguage=Python3 -no-listener -Xexact-output-dir -o fusion_flow/generated grammar/FusionFlow.g4
```

Commit only `FusionFlowLexer.py` and `FusionFlowParser.py`; the generated `.interp` and `.tokens` metadata is not needed at runtime. CI pins the tool JAR by SHA-256, regenerates both Python files, and rejects drift. Grammar tests verify the committed runtime file set and importability. Ruff, ty, and Git whitespace exclusions apply only to the generated directory.

## Suggested work split

1. **Core IR contract** is defined in `fusion_flow/core_ir.py`; keep it limited to the reviewed workflow subset.
2. **Language contract** owns `grammar/FusionFlow.g4`; ordinary operator registration, arity, and types stay checker/catalog-owned.
3. **Parser** owns `fusion_flow/generated/` and `fusion_flow/parser.py`: report syntax errors and produce lossless Core IR for later stages.
4. **Static checker** owns the Python checker: validate workflow legality and backend-independent constraints.
5. **Compiler** owns `fusion_flow/compiler.py`: lower checked Workflow Core IR through backend-specific hooks without selecting a target in the shared layer.
6. **Workflow Graph backend** owns `fusion_flow/graph_compiler.py`: compile real Core IR through the shared hooks into the `fusion_flow.workflow_graph` model while retaining residual assertions.
7. **Planning warnings** owns `fusion_flow/planning.py`: after Haitun lists planned steps and before it authors the DSL, check their declared syntax mappings and warn about missing or unavailable names. Each item is already at `Step` granularity; this phase does not introduce a higher-level requirement model and cannot detect steps that Haitun failed to list.
8. **Haitun integration** keeps the prompt, `run_flow`, and `flow_manage` entry points aligned with the G4 runtime.
9. **Compatibility** exposes the `workflow` Skill identity while preserving the internal `fusion_flow` package, `FusionFlow.g4` grammar, and persisted protocol names; explicit legacy `.flow.ts` requests still route to `fusion-flow-legacy` without implicit translation.

Dependency order: 1 + 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6; 2 -> 7; 4 + 5 + 7 -> 8. Workstream 9 runs throughout and gates activation.
