    """Safely scan or clean reclaimable files on the Windows C drive.

    The first scan in a Session requires user confirmation. Once confirmed,
    later scans in that Session may start directly. Cleaning is limited to
    unchanged files in the latest scan and requires affirmative user
    confirmation. Large files, exact duplicates, and stale Downloads outside
    known temporary/cache locations are report-only.

    Args:
        action: One of "scan", "status", or "clean".
        scan_approved: True after the user confirms the first scan in this Session.
        cleanup_approved: True only after the user reviews and approves the plan.
        categories: Optional safe categories: user_temp, windows_temp,
            crash_dumps, error_reports, shader_cache, thumbnail_cache.
        min_age_days: Minimum age; category-specific safety floors still apply.
        include_large_files: Report large user files without making them deletable.
        include_duplicate_files: Report exact duplicate user files without
            making them deletable.
        include_stale_downloads: Report old files in Downloads without making
            them deletable.
        stale_download_days: Minimum age for the stale Downloads report.
        include_recycle_bin: Include emptying C:\\$Recycle.Bin in the approval plan.
        empty_recycle_bin: Must match the approved plan at clean time.

    Returns:
        JSON containing the scan plan or verified cleanup result.
