# haitun-workspace 🐬

A consolidated psi-agent workspace whose agent is **Haitun (海豚)**. It combines:

- a de-branded OpenClaw-style system-prompt engine (all config kept **inside** the workspace),
- full **Workflow** authoring (the formal language defined by
  `FusionFlow.g4`, hosted by the `workflow` skill, with an explicit
  TypeScript fallback under `fusion-flow-legacy`, plus `flow_manage` + `flows/`),
- the hermes domain skill set + curated skills, and
- clean async file/shell tools, Serper web search, and environment-configured
  iFLYTEK STT/TTS tools.

See `AGENTS.md` for the full layout and conventions.

The Haibao ChatBI MCP Adapter, public tools, and Skill are bundled in this workspace. They
require an operator-provisioned private MCP server, which is not bundled or claimed to be
deployed in production. See [`docs/haibao-integration.md`](docs/haibao-integration.md) for
configuration, behavior, and production gates.

`HAIBAO_MCP_TOKEN` is process-global: one Haitun process/workspace deployment is one configured
Haibao principal and security boundary. It does not forward per-session identity. Never use one
token/process to serve users who require distinct authorization; deploy a separate Haitun
process, container, or workspace with a distinct token for each principal or distinct
authorization cohort.

## Run

Three terminals:

```bash
# 1) AI backend
uv run psi-agent ai \
  --provider openai --model <model> --api-key <key> \
  --base-url <url> --session-socket /tmp/ai.sock

# 2) Session (this workspace)
uv run psi-agent session \
  --workspace agents/feishu \
  --ai-socket /tmp/ai.sock --channel-socket /tmp/ch.sock

# 3) REPL
uv run psi-agent channel repl --session-socket /tmp/ch.sock
```

## Notes

- **First run** triggers a short onboarding (from `BOOTSTRAP.md`). Delete `BOOTSTRAP.md` to
  skip it.
- **Workflow** is the default for new workflows. Its formal G4 language uses the
  bundled Python parser/compiler and checked `run_flow` executor for Agent and Program Steps;
  Human waits continue through `run_flow_resume`. No separate setup is required. The existing
  `fusion-flow-legacy` Node/Fuclaw runtime remains available for explicit `.flow.ts` work:
  first use `cd agents/feishu/skills/fusion-flow-legacy && npm install`.
  One-off flows go under `flows/<task-slug>/`; saved reusable declarations go under
  `flows/workflows/<slug>/`. `flows/curated/` remains only as a compatibility catalog for
  `flow_manage` and legacy assets.
  For stateful sub-agent sessions, copy `bin/env.stateful.template` to
  `skills/fusion-flow-legacy/.env` and fill in the paths.
- **Serper search** needs psi-agent installed with the `mcp` extra and `uvx` on PATH.
- **Haibao ChatBI** needs the required operator-provisioned private MCP server and the three
  deployment-managed variables documented in `docs/haibao-integration.md`. The bundled Adapter,
  tools, and Skill do not provide the private service or database onboarding.
- Never put API keys in this workspace or in generated `.flow.ts` / `.env` files.
  The same rule applies to instruction payloads and generated `.workflow` / `.g4` files.

## Fusion Memory

Haitun consumes an operator-provisioned Fusion Memory MCP service over
**Streamable HTTP**. Before starting Haitun, the process starter configures the
endpoint. An explicit token-map path is optional when automatic registration is enabled:

```bash
export FUSION_MEMORY_MCP_URL="https://memory.example.com/mcp"
export FUSION_MEMORY_AUTO_REGISTER_FEISHU=1
export FUSION_MEMORY_ORGANIZATION_ID="org_example"
export PSI_FEISHU_APP_ID="cli_xxx"
export PSI_FEISHU_APP_SECRET="..."
# Optional override; default: {AppData}/fusion-memory/tokens.json
export FUSION_MEMORY_TOKEN_MAP_FILE="/absolute/path/to/memory_tokens.json"
```

`FUSION_MEMORY_MCP_URL` is the remote endpoint; TLS is terminated by its
reverse proxy. The map is keyed by Feishu `open_id`; each entry requires the
Memory-issued `token`. The default map is created with mode `0600` on first use.
`workspace_id` is provenance only and may be empty or
omitted, in which case it defaults to `haitun`. Keep the map outside this
workspace and source control, and never log, print, or return token values.

Map membership enables durable memory for that user. On the user's first
message after Haitun starts, the workspace automatically initiates
`memory_health` and starts a passive writer for that trusted
`feishu-<open_id>` Session. Completed user/assistant turns are persisted through
`memory_add_batch`; the same token shares memory across Sessions, while tokens
for different users remain isolated. Model-visible `<feishu_context>` never
selects credentials.

Generic work-arrangement records use the assignment tools backed by the same
remote Fusion Memory connection.
Feishu delivery for those records should use `assignment_send_card`, which
wraps the existing interactive-card sender with stable work-assignment actions.

When automatic registration is enabled, a missing private-chat user is added
to the map on first use. Otherwise, users absent from the map can chat normally
but receive no bearer token, connector, passive writer, checkpoint, or durable
memory. Duplicate token assignments reject the map, and token-map mode never
falls back to `FUSION_MEMORY_TOKEN`. When neither a map path nor automatic
registration is configured, the legacy single-user token/workspace/session
variables remain compatible.

Passive persistence stores only completed ordinary chat turns. Schedule,
heartbeat, compaction, tool-only, and incomplete rows are excluded. Unchanged
history files are not reparsed each polling interval. Removing a map entry
stops that Session's watcher and closes its cached MCP client.
Validated map snapshots are cached by file signature and refreshed only when
the file changes. Each active turn renews a five-minute watcher lease; idle
watcher/client resources are reclaimed and restart on the next message.

This workspace-level isolation assumes the Feishu Channel, Gateway, Session
runtime and management tools, host shell, and token-map file are trusted.
`feishu-<open_id>` is a routing convention rather than a cryptographic
principal. Protecting against callers that can forge Session IDs, invoke
cross-Session operations, or read the token map requires runtime authorization
and a privileged credential broker outside this example workspace.

The service operator owns provisioning, token creation and revocation, reverse
proxy configuration, and service storage. The operator also supervises the MCP,
model, and history services with `systemd` so they survive SSH disconnects and
restart after process failures. Haitun only consumes the remote service; it
does not create local memory services or fall back to another transport. MCP
outages do not block chat, and the background writer retries independently.
Use `memory_health` for explicit status and
`skills/fusion-memory-setup/SKILL.md` for operator recovery guidance.

## Smoke test

```bash
uv run python agents/feishu/systems/system.py
```

## Windows 安装包

`.github/workflows/pyinstaller.yml` 的 `haitun-inno-setup` job 会自动构建 Windows 安装程序：

1. PyInstaller 生成的 `psi-agent.exe` 被拷贝进本目录
2. Inno Setup（`.github/inno-setup/haitun.iss`）将整个 workspace 打包为安装程序
3. 安装后通过 `haitun.exe`（由 `.github/inno-setup/haitun.c` 编译）启动 Gateway，**显式**传入：
   - `--default-agent {app}`（安装目录即能力包：tools / skills / system）
   - `--default-workspace {Desktop}/haitun交付`（用户文件区；运行时解析桌面路径）

产物为 GitHub artifact `haitun-agent-installers`：完整包
`HaiTun_Agent_Setup.exe`、海豚组件包 `HaiTun_Agent_App_Setup.exe`、环境组件包
`msys-setup.exe`，以及 `haitun-version.txt` / `msys-version.txt`。

> `haitun.exe` 启动前会读取本目录下的 `.env`（若存在），把其中的 `KEY=VALUE` 注入 `psi-agent.exe` 的运行环境（跳过空行 / `#` 注释，剥离值两端成对引号）。

> 安装包自带一份 MSYS2（位于 `{app}\msys64`，含 bash/git/curl/ssh、以及 ucrt64 的 nodejs/npm/uv，保留 pacman）。`haitun.exe` 会把 `msys64\usr\bin` 与 `msys64\ucrt64\bin` 加到 `PATH` 最前，因此 `bash`、`node`、`npm`、`uv` 等在 Windows 上开箱即用，无需另装 Git Bash / Node。
