"""The ``feishu-sheet`` skill's endpoint table builds the requests Feishu documents.

Unlike the earlier migrations, this domain's tabled endpoints never had a tool to compare
against — spreadsheet *structure* (create, rename, add/insert/delete rows and columns,
merge, find/replace) was simply missing. So the frozen shapes below are the requests the
official documentation describes, field for field, and the tests prove the generic
``feishu_api`` path produces exactly those.

What earns this domain its own file is one asymmetry that no amount of prose fixes:

    POST   insert_dimension_range   startIndex/endIndex is 0-based, half-open
    DELETE dimension_range          startIndex/endIndex is 1-based, fully closed

Same two field names, same ``dimension`` wrapper, same spreadsheet — opposite conventions.
``{startIndex: 3, endIndex: 7}`` inserts **four** rows and deletes **five**, and both
calls return success either way, so a caller who generalized from one to the other
silently loses a row of someone's data. Each convention is pinned by its own test, with
the pitfall text asserted, so a later "cleanup" that unifies them fails loudly here.

The four read/write endpoints keep their tools (``feishu_sheet_read`` / ``_read_grid`` /
``_write`` / ``_append`` / ``_format``): a range written as a bare ``"<sheet_id>!A1"`` — no
end cell — is answered with ``code: 0`` and an empty ``updatedRange``, having written
nothing.

The three **write** rules name their tool but are deliberately **not** ``hard``: the
generic tool has warned rather than refused across ``/open-apis/sheets/`` since before this
skill existed, and tightening that would strand valid hand-built calls. What this file
pins for them is their *methods*, because writing values is a ``PUT`` while appending is a
``POST`` and the table is the only place that difference is written down.

The **read** rule is the one exception and is ``hard`` on purpose: hand-built cell reads
come back as raw ``mention`` / ``text_run`` objects with no row-number or column-letter
labels, and aligning those by eye is what produced the miscalls this skill exists to stop.
Refusing it removes the one path that looks like it works and doesn't. Advisory and hard
are pinned by separate tests, since collapsing them into one parametrized list is how a
deliberate tightening showed up as two failures in a list named "kept tools".
