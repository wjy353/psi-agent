"""Validate the feishu-todo-board-sync skill (personal ToDoList docx → team board sheet).

The skill itself is a pure SKILL.md recipe; the only new Python surface is
``feishu_sheet_read`` (range read, tested in test_feishu.py). These tests guard what
can silently rot: well-formed frontmatter, every ``feishu_*`` tool name the skill
tells the agent to call actually existing, and the three non-negotiable rules
(@-name attribution, caller-supplied target column, warn-before-overwrite) still
being stated in the body — those are the requirements the skill exists to enforce.
