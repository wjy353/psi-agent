"""Validate the todo-truthfulness-check skill (static layer 2: the truthfulness red line).

The skill is a pure SKILL.md rulebook (no new Python surface). It exists because
truthfulness cannot be read off the words of a TODO item: "已完成" can be a real
delivery or something that never happened, and the only way to tell them apart is to
reconcile the claim against task-system progress and acceptance records (TPMF's
「方案执行与验收」loop). These tests guard the parts whose removal would silently
bring that back: the four-and-only-four truthfulness verdicts, the claim-fact
reconciliation reusing the E1-E3 ladder, the acceptance-state machine (验收通过才算
完成), the D1-D6 SOP coverage, the red-line rule that 失实 needs human confirmation,
and the back-pointers from the three sibling skills into it.
