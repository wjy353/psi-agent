"""Validate the todo-writing-standard skill (the TODO filing standard as configuration).

The skill is a pure SKILL.md rulebook (no new Python surface). Its whole value claim is
that the standard and the execution loop are *physically separated* into five sections,
so that adapting to another company means replacing definitions only — the engine
section stays byte-identical and no new skill gets stacked on.

That claim is only worth something if the separation is actually enforced, so these
tests guard exactly the parts whose removal would silently turn the skill back into a
hardcoded one-off:

- the five sections all exist;
- the engine section contains no concrete level names, numbers, column names or tokens
  (the single assertion that keeps "replace the params, behaviour changes" true);
- the five discipline rules each carry all five required fields;
- 按时 defers to company-todo-fill-check instead of re-deriving the leave-check order;
- mentor check is only ever reminded, never stamped on the member's behalf;
- 生成 → 成员确认 → 写表 survives, and 澄清 forbids inventing missing acceptance data;
- the neighbouring skills route into and out of this one.
