"""Private helper for the ``canvas`` toolset — a live Excalidraw canvas over MCP.

The ``canvas`` tool exposes ``mcp-excalidraw-server``'s native tools (element
CRUD, layout, screenshots, export/import, mermaid, snapshots …) through the
workspace's :mod:`_mcp` bridge so the agent can draw on and inspect a real,
interactive visual canvas.

Unlike the ``browser`` tool, the Excalidraw MCP server is **stdio-only**, and
the *stateful* part lives in a **separate canvas web server** it auto-starts on
``http://127.0.0.1:3000``. That canvas server is detached and long-lived, so the
drawing survives across the short-lived stdio connections :mod:`_mcp` opens per
call — we do not have to manage a persistent process ourselves the way the
browser tool does.

This module only builds the launch command and environment (and resolves ``npx``
across platforms). Node.js / ``npx`` must be on PATH; the first call downloads
``mcp-excalidraw-server`` and boots the canvas server. Screenshots, image
export, and mermaid rendering additionally need an **open browser tab** at the
canvas URL (they render in the frontend) — the ``browser`` tool can open it.

Env knobs (all optional): ``CANVAS_MCP_PACKAGE`` (default
``mcp-excalidraw-server@latest``), ``EXPRESS_SERVER_URL`` (default
``http://127.0.0.1:3000``), ``PORT`` / ``HOST``, ``ENABLE_CANVAS_SYNC`` (default
``true``), ``EXCALIDRAW_NO_AUTOSTART``, ``EXCALIDRAW_EXPORT_DIR`` (defaults to the
workspace dir so exported ``.excalidraw`` files land in the repo).
