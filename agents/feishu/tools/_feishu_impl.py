"""Private helper for the Feishu tools — authenticated client + request execution.

Wraps the ``lark_channel`` SDK (already a project dependency): builds one
authenticated ``Client`` from ``PSI_FEISHU_APP_ID`` / ``PSI_FEISHU_APP_SECRET``,
caches it module-level, and runs ``BaseRequest`` objects through the SDK's native
async ``arequest``. Drive-comment requests reuse the SDK's ready-made builders;
docx/doc/sheet raw-content and create-reply requests are hand-built the same way
the SDK's own ``api/drive/comment.py`` does it.

**What lives where.** This file is the shared layer every Feishu domain needs — the
client, the tenant/user token dance (``_invoke``), rate-limit retries, capability
inference, and the UAT/identity stores. The per-domain implementations were split
out to ``_feishu/{message,doc,sheet,bitable,contact,approval,auth,calendar,drive,
attendance,task}.py`` and are re-exported at the bottom of this file, so importing
this module still reaches every name it always did and each domain can be edited,
reviewed, and tested on its own.

Three rules keep that split honest. A domain module reaches back here as ``_core``
rather than copying anything down, so patching ``_feishu_impl._invoke`` (or
``_get_client``, ``_get_valid_uat``, ...) still takes effect everywhere. A domain
that needs another domain's helper goes through ``_core`` too, never by importing
its sibling — one namespace stays authoritative for every name. And anything that
rebinds a module-level variable (``global _client``, ``global _token_store``) stays
in the same file as that variable: ``global`` binds in its own module, so moving
such a function would reset a fresh name of its own and leave the real cache alone.

# ── Document search (needs user_access_token) ────────────────────────────────
#
# Feishu's doc search (/suite/docs-api/search/object) only accepts a
# user_access_token (UAT), not the bot's tenant token — it returns docs the
# authorizing USER can see. We use the SDK's device-flow OAuth to obtain/refresh
# a UAT, cache it in <workspace>/.psi/feishu/uat.json (plaintext — dev use), and
# call the search endpoint with a hand-built BaseRequest carrying the UAT.

# Ask the user for the permissions the task actually needs, instead of one fixed
# blanket set. But scopes can't be free text: a scope Feishu doesn't recognize
# makes it reject the whole authorize page (error 20043), so an LLM inventing
# "docx:write" would break authorization outright rather than degrade. Callers
# therefore name CAPABILITIES from this catalog and the real scope strings stay
# here, where they can be verified against Feishu's console.

# Every scope string below is one this project has already used against the live
# Feishu console. Adding a capability means verifying its scope there first —
