"""Markdown → native Feishu docx blocks, through Feishu's own converter.

``feishu_doc_append_content`` used to map each line to one of two blocks: a heading or
a paragraph. Anything else Markdown can express — a ``| a | b |`` table, a ``- `` list,
``**bold**``, a fenced code block — was written as the *literal source text*, so a doc
"with a table in it" arrived as rows of pipes and dashes: no grid, nothing draggable or
resizable, and no way to sort or edit a column.

Feishu converts Markdown itself: ``POST docx/v1/documents/blocks/convert`` takes
``{content_type: "markdown", content}`` and returns a flat ``blocks`` list plus the
``first_level_block_ids`` that attach at the insert point — exactly the shape the
``/descendant`` endpoint writes. So the conversion is not reimplemented here; this module
is the plumbing between the two endpoints, plus the three things the pair gets wrong:

1. **``merge_info`` must be stripped.** ``convert`` emits it on every table property;
   ``/descendant`` rejects the very payload its sibling produced with ``1770001 invalid
   param``. Measured by bisecting the payload — dropping it is the only change a table
   needs. The table's ``children`` must *stay* (dropping those gives ``1770041 open
   schema mismatch``).
2. **A converted table has no ``header_row``.** Every Markdown table has a header row by
   syntax, so it is set here; otherwise the first row renders as ordinary cells.
3. **``/descendant`` takes at most 1000 blocks per call** (measured: 1000 succeeds, 1001
   fails with ``99992402``). Since a table costs ``2 x rows x columns`` blocks, a 61x12
   table is 1465 — over the cap on its own, and a table cannot be split across calls. So
   an oversized table is created with as many rows as fit, then grown with
   ``insert_table_row`` and filled through ``blocks/batch_update``.

Plain prose (no Markdown beyond headings) is left on the old local path: it needs no
round-trip, and one-paragraph-per-line is how existing haitun docs are written.

``normalize_for_convert`` sits in front of the converter because "the Markdown didn't
render" almost never means the converter is broken — it means the text never reached it,
or reached it in a shape CommonMark doesn't read as a table. Four measured cases, all of
which used to land in the document as literal Markdown source:

* **Prose reflow.** The converter joins single newlines into one paragraph (CommonMark
  soft breaks). One ``**bold**`` anywhere routed the *whole* body here, so a report
  written one-paragraph-per-line collapsed into a single block. Prose lines are separated
  by blank lines before converting, except where a construct spans them (an unclosed
  ``**`` run, a fence, a table, a list/quote continuation).
* **Ragged tables.** A delimiter row whose cell count differs from the header is not a
  table to CommonMark at all — ``| a | b | c |`` over ``| --- | --- |`` came back as one
  text block of pipes. Both rows are padded to the widest row instead.
* **Missing delimiter row.** Two pipe rows with no ``| --- |`` between them is not a
  table either; the delimiter is inserted when the block otherwise looks like one.
* **Borderless tables.** ``a | b`` with no outer pipes is valid GFM and the converter
  handles it — but ``has_rich_markdown`` never matched it, so it never got here.

Fenced code is copied through verbatim: every rule above would corrupt it.
