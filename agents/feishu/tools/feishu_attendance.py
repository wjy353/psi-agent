"""Feishu/Lark attendance (考勤) tool — query clock-in/out results (read-only).

Reading the admin console (attendance groups 考勤组 and shifts 班次) is four plain GETs
and lives in the ``feishu-attendance`` skill's endpoint table. What is left here is the
one call whose output is not a response: clock results arrive buried in
``user_task_results[].records[].check_in_record``, and this flattens them to one row per
person per day, turning each ``check_time`` (an epoch-seconds *string*) into local time.
It also lifts ``invalid_user_ids`` / ``unauthorized_user_ids`` to the top level, which is
how ``feishu-leave-audit-board`` and ``feishu-attendance-payroll`` tell "no data" apart
from "missed the punch".

Read-only — this never clocks in on anyone's behalf.

Requires ``PSI_FEISHU_APP_ID`` / ``PSI_FEISHU_APP_SECRET``, the app to be a
**Custom App** with the ``attendance:task:readonly`` scope, and a data-permission
scope granted in the Feishu attendance admin console (else 1220004/1220005).
