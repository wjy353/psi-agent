"""Feishu/Lark user authorization and write-ownership identity.

Three things, three sets of tools:

**Which permissions** — some Feishu APIs act on behalf of a USER and need a
user_access_token the bot's app credentials can't provide. Authorization asks only
for the CAPABILITIES the task needs, and each grant is the union of those and
everything already granted, so old abilities are never lost. Which capabilities a
user already has is remembered, so a second task needing the same ones never
re-prompts.

**Getting the code back** — the happy path asks the user for **no copy-pasting**:
``feishu_auth_start`` returns a browser URL to approve, and — when an automatic
callback channel is available (``auto_receive=True``) — the code arrives by itself and
the exchange finishes without the user copying anything. The code comes back either
through the Gateway's ``/oauth/callback`` relay (works when the user approves on a
phone) or through a one-shot ``127.0.0.1`` listener (same machine only); see
``_oauth_receiver``. Only when neither channel is available does the old manual path
apply: the user copies ``code=...`` out of the browser address bar and hands it to
``feishu_auth_complete``.

**Collecting it without freezing the conversation** — the code takes as long to come
back as the user takes to approve, so the only question is *who* waits. Never the turn:
a tool call runs inside the Session's turn lock, so a tool that waits for minutes makes
everything the user says queue behind it — that is what "the bot is dead" looks like.
``feishu_auth_collect`` therefore hands the waiting to a task detached from the turn and
returns immediately. Use it on every path where the code is still outstanding — after a
``link_auto`` link, and in the ``<feishu_card_action>`` turn right after a card tap.
``feishu_auth_check`` looks once and returns, for the turn where the user reports back. No
tool waits inside the turn — that is deliberate, not an omission.

**Finishing the work the authorization was for** — a granted token is not the point; the
document the user wanted under their own name is. The background collector therefore does
not merely announce success: it **starts a new turn** on the same session
(``psi_agent.session.live_agent``) carrying a ``<feishu_auth_granted>`` block, and that
turn redoes the blocked step as the user and reports the result. Two consequences for the
turn that *starts* a collector: it must not promise "I'll continue once you approve" —
something else keeps that promise — and it must not narrate the wait at all, because a
"waiting for your authorization" line typically arrives after the finished reply and
reads as a contradiction.

**How to ask** — call ``feishu_auth_request`` and let it choose. There are three ways to
ask, in descending order of how little the user has to do, and it returns the first one
this deployment can actually deliver (reporting the chosen ``tier``):

1. ``card`` — an interactive card whose single button both opens the consent page and
   calls back, so the agent finishes its turn at once and waits only when the click
   arrives. Sent by ``feishu_auth_card``.
2. ``link_auto`` — the plain ``authorize_url``, with the code still returning by itself
   through the callback channel. No copying, but the user has to open the link.
3. ``link_manual`` — the same URL with **no** automatic channel behind it, so the user
   copies ``code=...`` out of the address bar into ``feishu_auth_complete``.

Tier 1 needs a private chat to send the card to; tiers 1 and 2 both need an automatic
callback channel. Falling back is reported, never silent — the first two promise "no
copying", so a deployment that cannot keep that promise must say so.

**Who owns the output** — a created document/table/task belongs to whoever created
it. ``feishu_identity_set`` records whether this user wants writes done under their
own Feishu identity (output owned by them, needs authorization) or under the bot's
(output owned by the bot). Write tools return ``need_identity_choice`` until that is
answered, rather than guessing.

Tokens are cached in ``<workspace>/.psi/feishu/uat.json`` (plaintext, local dev use;
auto-refreshed later). Tokens and choices are keyed per user via ``user_key`` (the
sender's open_id), so multiple people stay independent; empty ``user_key`` shares a
single ``default`` slot.

Requires ``PSI_FEISHU_APP_ID`` / ``PSI_FEISHU_APP_SECRET`` and a redirect URI
registered in the app's security settings. The flow uses PKCE (S256). The app must
have the corresponding scopes enabled in its Feishu console permissions.

    Send ``authorize_url`` to the user and have them approve. If the result says
    ``auto_receive=True``, do NOT ask them for any code — finish your turn and either call
    ``feishu_auth_collect`` (it collects in the background, so the code lands without the
    user having to prompt you again) or ask them to say a word once approved and call
    ``feishu_auth_check`` in that later turn. Never make the sending turn wait for the
    code. Only if ``auto_receive=False`` fall back to the manual path
    (user copies ``code=`` from the browser address bar into ``feishu_auth_complete``).

    Pass the ``capabilities`` the current task actually needs — typically the
    ``need_capabilities`` list a tool just returned alongside ``need_auth``. The
    request is automatically widened to include everything this user already
    granted, so authorizing again never costs them an existing ability.

    Args:
        user_key: The message sender's open_id (from the injected ``<feishu_context>``

            same value to ``feishu_auth_collect`` / ``feishu_auth_complete`` /
            ``feishu_docs_search``. Empty shares a single ``default`` slot

        capabilities: Comma-separated capability keys to request, e.g.
            ``"docx_write,wiki_write"``. Valid keys: ``docs_read``, ``drive_read``,
            ``drive_write`` (includes spreadsheets), ``docx_write``, ``wiki_write``,

            Do NOT pass raw Feishu scope strings — an invalid scope makes Feishu
            reject the whole authorize page (error 20043), so unknown keys are refused
            here instead.
        chat_id: Optional ``oc_`` chat id of the conversation the user will come
            back to (from ``<feishu_context>`` ``chat_id``). When given, the
            post-approval landing page shows a "回到飞书对话" button that deep-links
            straight back into that chat.

    One call handles the whole "I need this user's authorization" case. It tries the three
    ways in a fixed order and returns the first that works, so you don't have to know what
    this deployment supports:

       back. **Finish your turn now.** In the later ``<feishu_card_action>`` turn whose
       ``dispatch.handler`` is ``feishu_auth_collect``, call that with the ``user_key`` from
       the callback value — it collects in the background, so that turn ends at once too.
       Do not also send the link as text.
    2. ``tier="link_auto"`` — website authorization with **no code to copy**. Send the user
       ``authorize_url`` and **finish your turn**; call ``feishu_auth_collect`` to have the
       code picked up in the background, or ask them to say a word once approved and
       ``feishu_auth_check`` in that later turn. Never wait in this turn: the code keeps for
       ~10 minutes, so blocking buys nothing and costs the user everything they try to say
       meanwhile.
    3. ``tier="link_manual"`` — website authorization that **does** need a copy. Send
       ``authorize_url``, then ask the user for the ``code=`` in their address bar (the full
       URL is fine too) and pass it to ``feishu_auth_complete``.

    When it falls back, ``downgraded_from`` and ``downgrade_reason`` say why — tell the user
    plainly rather than implying the smoother path was used. Always read ``tier`` to decide
    your next move; ``next_step`` spells it out.

    Args:
        user_key: The message sender's open_id (from ``<feishu_context>`` ``sender_open_id``).

        capabilities: Comma-separated capability keys the task needs — typically the

            group is routed to the tapper's own session, which cannot see the pending
            authorization recorded here.
        chat_id: The current conversation's ``oc_`` chat id (from ``<feishu_context>``
            ``chat_id``). Required for the "回到飞书对话" landing-page button; when empty
            the page shows only the close button.

    Prefer ``feishu_auth_request``, which tries this first and falls back on its own. Use
    this directly only when you want the card and nothing else — it does not downgrade.

    Preferred over sending ``feishu_auth_start``'s ``authorize_url`` as text: the card's
    button opens the Feishu consent page *and* calls back to you in one tap, so you learn
    the user acted instead of guessing when to start waiting. Use it whenever a tool
    returns ``need_auth=True`` and you have the user's open_id.

    **Finish your turn right after this returns.** Do not wait for anything in this turn and
    do not also send the link as text. When the user taps the button, Feishu delivers the
    click to you as a ``<feishu_card_action>`` turn whose ``dispatch.handler`` is
    ``feishu_auth_collect``; call that *then*, with the ``user_key`` carried in the callback
    value. It hands the waiting to a background task, so that turn ends immediately as well
    — the user has only just reached the consent page at that point, and holding the turn
    open until they finish would block everything else they say.

    The card is single-use. If the user taps it but never presses 「同意授权」 on the page,
    that card is spent: send a fresh one with this tool rather than asking them to tap again.

    Falls back with ``manual_required=True`` when the deployment has no automatic callback
    channel (no ``PSI_OAUTH_CALLBACK_BASE`` and no usable loopback) — a button would then

    the turn that sends a ``link_auto`` ``authorize_url``. Waiting is unavoidable — users
    open the page, may log in first, and only then approve — but *who* waits is the whole
    problem. Waiting inside the tool call means waiting inside the
    Session's turn lock, so everything the user says for those minutes queues behind it
    and the bot looks dead. This hands the waiting to a task detached from the turn, so
