"""Feishu/Lark messaging tools — send, edit, and read messages.

These let the bot proactively post to a group/user, form a native Feishu
**thread** (topic), fix what it already sent, and read the messages under a chat or
thread.

Beyond plain text, a message can carry an image, a file, a voice clip, a video, rich
text or an interactive card — each with its own tool below, because the two-step
upload dance and the ``image_key`` / ``file_key`` split are exactly what goes wrong
when it's left to the caller.

What is *not* here is everything that is one plain request against an existing
message: 回复、撤回、表情回应、消息列表、置顶、转发/合并转发. Those are an endpoint
table now — call ``feishu_api`` and read the ``feishu-message`` skill first, which
carries their constraints (message ids must be ``om_``, the reaction key casing,
合并转发 must stay within one conversation) in a form that is checked before the
request goes out.

Fixing a sent message is ``feishu_message_edit`` (content changes in place, the
``message_id`` survives), not recall-and-resend.

To @-mention someone, embed ``<at user_id="ou_xxx"></at>`` in the ``text`` (the
value is the person's open_id). ``feishu_message_send`` auto-detects such tags and
sends a rich-text ``post`` so the mention renders — a raw ``<at>`` in a plain text
message would otherwise show up literally.

    """Send an **interactive card** message — buttons, forms, inputs, selectors, date pickers.

    Far richer than ``feishu_message_send`` (plain text): a card can carry clickable
    buttons, a form (input fields / dropdowns / date pickers) the recipient fills in and
    submits, styled headers, multi-column layouts, images and dividers. Use it whenever
    you want the recipient to *act* (approve/reject, pick an option, submit a value)
    rather than just read.

    You build the card yourself and pass it as a JSON string in ``card_json``. Both
    Feishu card formats are accepted and sent verbatim. For interactive button
    groups and forms, the legacy format is the safest default::

        {"config": {"wide_screen_mode": true},
         "header": {"title": {"tag": "plain_text", "content": "请假审批"}, "template": "blue"},
         "elements": [
           {"tag": "markdown", "content": "**张三** 申请年假 2 天"},
           {"tag": "action", "actions": [
             {"tag": "button", "text": {"tag": "plain_text", "content": "同意"},
              "type": "primary", "value": {"action": "approve", "id": "req_1"}},
             {"tag": "button", "text": {"tag": "plain_text", "content": "驳回"},
              "type": "danger", "value": {"action": "reject", "id": "req_1"}}]}]}

    Card 2.0 (``{"schema": "2.0", ...}``) is also accepted, but it does **not**
    support the legacy ``{"tag": "action"}`` container. Put Card 2.0-supported
    controls directly under ``body.elements`` instead of copying the legacy layout.

    Selectors / date pickers go inside an ``action`` element (``select_static`` with
    ``options``, ``date_picker``, ``picker_time``, …). When their selected value must reach
    the agent reliably, put them inside a ``form`` and use a submit action so Feishu returns
    the result in ``form_value``. The SDK's standalone selector/date callback deduplication
    does not distinguish every changed selection. Anything the Feishu 消息卡片 spec supports
    is still sent as-is.

    Button/form actions are delivered back to the operator's agent session as the next
    structured user turn, encoded as JSON inside ``<feishu_card_action>``. When sending to
    another person, provide both ``business_context_json`` and ``action_handlers_json`` so
    their agent receives the full original card, source Session/user, business facts, and a
    deterministic dispatch result. The Channel selects the handler but does not execute it or
    bypass the LLM. Handler-map keys, handler identifiers, and callback action IDs must be
    canonical strings without surrounding whitespace and are matched exactly. With a non-empty
    handler map, an unknown action produces
    ``matched=false`` and ``handler=null``; the recipient agent must not invent or execute an
    unmatched handler. Only a successfully loaded v1/v2 snapshot that confirms there was no
    handler map may fall back to using ``value.action`` / ``action_id`` as the handler for
    compatibility. Missing or invalid snapshots fail closed. The first callback leaves a durable
    consumed tombstone, so later callbacks are ignored across Channel processes and restarts.

    When handling the resulting ``<feishu_card_action>``, the updated original card already
    acknowledges the selected option. Do not narrate the click or announce a planned action before
    calling the matched handler. After the handler succeeds, finish with zero assistant content:
    do not emit ``NO_REPLY`` or a success confirmation. Reply only when the operator still needs a
    warning, partial-failure detail, permission problem, or required next step. An unmatched or
    failed handler must never be reported as successful.

    Every actionable element's ``value`` must include an explicit action name and a stable
    business identifier such as ``request_id``; different buttons need different values.
    Before a consequential operation, re-check authorization and current business state;
    keep the underlying operation idempotent because delivery is at-least-once. By default a
    card is single-use: the first accepted button/form action preserves its original content,
    replaces its interactive region with a read-only selected-value note, and ignores later
    actions from the same card. Send a new card when the user must submit another response —
    unless you pass ``multi_use=True`` (see below).

    After a successful call, the card is already visible to the recipient. If it carries all
    necessary user-facing information, finish with zero assistant content: do not emit ``NO_REPLY``,
    confirm delivery, or repeat its content and button labels. If necessary information is not
    already conveyed by the card, such as a warning, partial failure, or required next step, reply
    with only that information; never suppress it.

    If the card is sent but its callback snapshot cannot be saved, the result is
    ``ok=false, sent=true, callback_context_saved=false``. Report that necessary partial failure,
    but do not retry the send and create a duplicate card. A custom Feishu Channel AppData root
    must match the Gateway/workspace-tool root; prefer setting ``PSI_APPDATA`` for both processes.

    Args:
        receive_id: Target id — a chat_id (oc_...), open_id (ou_...), user_id, union_id, or email.
        card_json: The full Feishu card as a JSON object string (see examples above).
        receive_id_type: Type of receive_id — chat_id, open_id, user_id, union_id, or email.
            Auto-detected from the id prefix (oc_→chat_id, ou_→open_id, ...); only set it
            explicitly for a bare user_id.
        user_key: The sender's open_id (from ``<feishu_context>``) as a fallback identity;
            harmless to pass, leave empty in single-user scenarios.
        business_context_json: JSON object with the business facts the recipient's agent needs
            when handling a click, such as request type, request ID, requester, authorization
            facts, and current state. Do not rely on the recipient having the sender's history.
            Must be a JSON object string; falsey non-string values are rejected.
        action_handlers_json: JSON object mapping each ``value.action`` to a deterministic handler
            identifier, for example ``{"approve":"approval_decide","reject":"approval_decide"}``.
            Include every allowed action; unmatched configured actions are deliberately not
            dispatched. Keys and values must be non-empty canonical strings without surrounding
            whitespace.
        multi_use: Consume each action **independently** instead of retiring the whole card on
            the first click. This is what makes a TODO-list card work: ticking one row marks
            that row done (``● ~~文字~~``) and updates the card in place, while every other row
            keeps its button. Repeat clicks on an already-ticked row are still rejected exactly
            once, so handlers stay at-most-once per row. Requires each row's ``value.action``
            to be distinct and canonical — rows without a usable action id fall back to
            whole-card deduplication. Leave ``False`` for approve/reject and any card where a
            second answer must be impossible.

    The key is an IM key and is **not** interchangeable with a drive ``file_token`` from

    Searches **as the asking person**, so it finds what they can see — Feishu accepts no

    there is no bot-wide variant to fall back on. The person must have authorized once
    (``feishu_auth_card`` / ``feishu_auth_start``).

    Feishu returns message ids only, so each hit is read back: results carry the actual
    ``text``, ``chat_id``, sender and time. Hits the bot cannot read come back with
    ``readable: false`` and just their id — normally a chat the bot isn't in — rather than
    being silently dropped, so a partial answer is visible as partial.

    endpoint that ``feishu_file_download`` uses).

    Where to get ``file_key``:
    - The image the user just sent is usually already auto-downloaded and attached
      to the turn — you don't need this tool for it. **Exception:** if the turn
      carries a ``<feishu_attachments>`` block instead of a file, nothing was

      you cannot read). Then this tool is the *only* way to get the bytes: pass
      the ``message_id`` and ``file_key`` straight from that block.
    - For an image found in history, read the chat/thread with
      ``feishu_thread_read`` (or ``GET /open-apis/im/v1/messages`` via
      ``feishu_api``), then parse the message's

        save_path: Local filesystem path to write the image to (parent dirs created).

            as that user when the bot can't see the message; empty uses the bot's

    Feishu only exposes the **readers**; there is no unread endpoint. So the unread

    Two hard limits are Feishu's, not ours, and both come back as a ``hint``:
    only messages the **bot itself sent** can be queried (someone else's message
    gives 230012 — there is no way around it), and only within **7 days** of

            Must be a message the bot sent, within the last 7 days.
