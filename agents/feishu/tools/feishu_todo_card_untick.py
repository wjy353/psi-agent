"""Handle an undo on a TODO-list card: reopen the linked Feishu task.

The counterpart to ``feishu_todo_card_tick``. Dispatched by a done row's 「撤销」button
(only present when that row has rounds left, see ``_todo_card_impl._UNDO_ROUNDS``).
Reopens the Feishu task, reverts the mentor-ledger 状态 if the row carries one, and edits
the card back to an open, tickable row for the next round — via
``_todo_card_impl._apply_row_transition`` (see that module's docstring for why the whole
card is rebuilt from an embedded ``card_state`` blob rather than splicing Feishu's own
click-time card snapshot).

    """Reopen the Feishu task behind one un-ticked TODO row, and offer to tick it again.

    The handler for a done TODO card row's 「撤销」button (``feishu_todo_card_send`` /
    ``feishu_todo_card_tick``). Session injects the ``<feishu_card_action>`` payload as
    ``card_action_json``; the clicked row's ``task_guid``, title, and round come from its
    ``value`` — same shape as ``feishu_todo_card_tick``, just the opposite direction.

    Reopening is written as ``task.completed_at`` = the string ``"0"`` with
    ``update_fields: ["completed_at"]`` — this is Feishu's documented way to reopen a task
    (see the ``feishu-task`` skill). A row carrying no ``task_guid`` is reported as
    un-ticked-only, since there is no task to move; that is not an error. If the row is
    wired to a mentor ledger, that record's 状态 field is reverted to 待开始, matching what
    a never-ticked row would show.

    The Channel already gave the clicked 「撤销」button an instant generic "consumed" look
    before this runs (it does not know this action means "go back to open" — that is
    exactly why this tool exists). This tool edits the card a second time
    (``feishu_message_edit_card``, via ``_todo_card_impl._apply_row_transition``) to
    restore the row to its open state with a fresh「标记完成」button for the next round —
    unless this was already the last round, in which case the row stays locked with no
    button (should not normally happen: the「撤销」button is only ever offered when a
    round remains, see ``feishu_todo_card_tick``).

    Args:
        card_action_json: The ``<feishu_card_action>`` JSON (injected by Session).
        user_key: The clicker's open_id. Pass it so the task is reopened as that person
            when the bot's own token is not a task member.
