    """List the contents of a directory so folders and files can be recognized.

    Directories are suffixed with ``/`` to distinguish them from files. Use this
    when a path is a folder (``read`` only handles individual files). To locate
    files recursively by glob pattern (e.g. ``**/*.py``) rather than browsing a
    tree level by level, use ``find_files`` instead.

    Relative paths (including default ``.``) resolve under the current Session
    workspace (``get_workspace()``). Absolute paths are used as-is.

    Args:
        dir_path: Path to the directory to list (defaults to the workspace root).
        recursive: When True, walk sub-directories and list their contents too.
        max_entries: Maximum number of entries to return (guards against huge trees).

    Returns:
        A newline-separated listing of entries, or an error message if the path
        cannot be listed.
