It lives here, beside ``make_compaction_signal``, because the ceiling *is* part
of the agreement between layers: the AI side raises the signal against it and
the Session side enforces a budget against it, both reading the same env var.
Two layers previously kept their own fallback (100000 on the AI side, 200000 on
the Session side), which is exactly the drift this module exists to prevent.

The number sits above this deployment's measured fixed overhead. A 181218-char
production system prompt is ~117k tokens, so a 100000 ceiling puts the prompt
alone over budget before any history is added — an unsatisfiable request that no
amount of eliding or compacting can fix. That arithmetic is why one attendance
task compacted 50 times while its token count climbed to 400093.

Session additionally refuses to adopt an AI-side ceiling below
``session.request_assembly.MIN_ADOPTABLE_TOKENS``, so enforcement stays correct
even against an operator who lowers only one side.
