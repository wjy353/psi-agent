Measured against real traffic rather than guessed: rounds per turn came out at
p50=3, p90=13, max=49.  The previous default of 128 sat so far above the
distribution that it could never be reached — a runaway loop burned 128 model
calls before stopping, so in practice there was no ceiling at all.  20 sits above
p90 and leaves normal turns untouched while capping a runaway at roughly a sixth
of the old cost.

It does *not* sit above the observed max, and that is deliberate: a 49-round turn
is the shape this limit exists to stop.  Hitting the limit therefore moves from
"never" to "occasionally", which is why the stop is reported explicitly to the
user (``MAX_ROUNDS_NOTICE``) instead of just to the log.  Callers that legitimately
need more rounds should pass ``max_tool_rounds`` explicitly.

Single source of truth for all three entry points (``Session``,
``SessionAgent.__init__``, ``SessionAgent.create``) — they drifted as separate
literals before, so changing "the default" meant finding every copy.

Written for the person in the chat, not for a log reader: the bare
``[Max tool rounds reached]`` this replaces was an untranslated developer token
that arrived glued to whatever interstitial narration the model had produced
("让我再查一下。[Max tool rounds reached]"), so a Feishu user saw a half-finished
reply with a bracketed English string and no way to tell a round-limit stop from
a crash.  It states what happened, why, and what to do next, and carries the
round count so the log line and the chat agree on the same number.

Leading blank line separates it from the model's own last words; the bracketed
prefix stays so operators grepping histories keep a stable marker.
