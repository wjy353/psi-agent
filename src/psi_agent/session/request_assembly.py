"""The one place that decides how big a request may be — and enforces it.

``session/agent.py`` assembles exactly one request body per model round, from
exactly two inputs: the projected history and the tool schemas.  Every token
this system spends flows through that spot, which is why the budget lives here
rather than anywhere else.

**What moved, and why it is not a new abstraction.**  ``max_context_tokens``
already existed; it was just enforced in the wrong place.  The AI layer
*observed* it (``ai/server.py``: compare ``usage.prompt_tokens`` against the
threshold, emit a signal) and the Session layer *reacted* to it after the fact
(``agent.py._maybe_compact``).  Reacting after the fact means the oversized
request was already sent — and if it was oversized enough to be rejected
outright, the stream never produced usage, so the signal never fired, so
nothing shrank, so the next turn rebuilt the same request.  That deadlock
survived restarts because the history was on disk; it took hand-editing a
history file in production to break it (2026-09-02).

:func:`RequestAssembler.build` closes that loop by construction: an oversized
request can no longer be *assembled*, so it can no longer be sent.

**Two levels of cost control, in strict priority order.**

1. **Elision** (here).  Drop the oldest, largest rows and leave a handle in
   their place.  Deterministic, always succeeds, pure local string work, zero
   upstream calls.  This is what makes the budget a guarantee.
2. **Compaction** (``agent.py._maybe_compact``).  An LLM summarizes the
   history, preserving meaning.  Best-effort, can fail, takes ~18s and holds
   the session lock.

Level 1 owns correctness; level 2 only improves quality.  A failed compaction
no longer means deadlock — it means this turn's elision reads a little rougher.

**Why elision must be hysteretic — see :attr:`SHRINK_TARGET_FRACTION`.**  This
is the constraint that makes a naive implementation *worse* than doing nothing.

**Why characters, not tokens.**  Tokenizing means a tokenizer dependency, and a
per-provider one at that.  Instead the budget is denominated in characters and
the conversion ratio is calibrated from the upstream's own arithmetic: every
successful turn reports ``usage.prompt_tokens`` for a request whose character
count we just measured, so the ratio for the next turn is a division.  A single
hardcoded ratio could not work — measured in this very repo, Chinese-dense
prompt text runs ~1.56 chars/token while ASCII JSON tool results run ~3.5-4,
a 2.6x spread.

why upstream prefix caching hits 99.7% here (measured against deepseek-v4-flash
on 2026-09-03: 19456 of 19519 prompt tokens served from cache on an unchanged
prefix; changing only the tail cost 2 extra tokens).

Any shrink, however, rewrites the prefix — dropped rows are *old* rows — and
takes the entire cache with it.  So an implementation that trims just enough to
fit pays a full cache miss on *every* turn, which is strictly more expensive
than never trimming at all.  Trimming to half the budget instead pays that miss
once and then lets many subsequent turns grow on one stable prefix.

Put plainly: don't throw out one suitcase item a day — clear out half the trunk
once.

``agent.py``'s ``COMPACTION_COOLDOWN_FRACTION`` is the same instinct applied to
compaction, but measured in upstream-reported tokens (only available after the
fact) rather than at the assembly point.  This constant is where that instinct

was dropped — a silent cut leaves it answering from data it believes complete,
the same trap ``truncate_tool_result`` documents.  The handle names where the
original still lives, so elision is recoverable rather than destructive.

Deliberately terse, and that terseness is load-bearing rather than a style
choice.  The handle is paid **once per elided row**, so a sentence explaining
what a handle is and how to retrieve it — which the first draft of this module
carried, at ~220 chars — turns into tens of kilobytes on exactly the histories
that were already too big, and becomes an un-elidible floor of its own: a first
run against a deliberately tight budget could not get under it no matter how
many rows it elided.  That explanation belongs in the system prompt, where it is
